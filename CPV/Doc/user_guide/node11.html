4.4.1  Self-interaction Correction </A>
</H3>

<P>
The self-interaction correction (SIC) included in the <TT>CP</TT> package is based
on the Constrained Local-Spin-Density approach proposed my F. Mauri and 
coworkers (M. D'Avezac et al. PRB 71, 205210 (2005)). It was used for
the first time in Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO by F. Baletto, C. Cavazzoni 
and S.Scandolo (PRL 95, 176801 (2005)).

<P>
This approach is a simple and nice way to treat ONE, and only one, 
excess charge. It is moreover necessary to check a priori that 
the spin-up and spin-down eigenvalues are not too different, for the 
corresponding neutral system, working in the Local-Spin-Density 
Approximation (setting <TT>nspin = 2</TT>). If these two conditions are satisfied
and you are interest in charged systems, you can apply the SIC.
This approach is a on-the-fly method to correct the self-interaction 
with the excess charge with itself.

<P>
Briefly, both the Hartree and the XC part have been 
corrected to avoid the interaction of the excess charge with itself.

<P>
For example, for the Boron atoms, where we have an even number of 
electrons (valence electrons = 3), the parameters for working with
the SIC are:
<PRE>
           &amp;system
           nbnd= 2,
           tot_magnetization=1,
           sic_alpha = 1.d0,
           sic_epsilon = 1.0d0,
           sic = 'sic_mac',
           force_pairing = .true.,
</PRE>
The two main parameters are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>force_pairing = .true.</TT>, which forces the paired electrons to be the same;
<BR><TT>sic='sic_mac'</TT>, which instructs the code to use Mauri's correction.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>Warning</B>: 
This approach has known problems for dissociation mechanism
driven by excess electrons.

<P>
Comment 1:
Two parameters, <TT>sic_alpha</TT> and <TT>sic_epsilon'</TT>, have been introduced 
following the suggestion of M. Sprik (ICR(05)) to treat the radical
(OH)-H<SUB>2</SUB>O. In any case, a complete ab-initio approach is followed 
using <TT>sic_alpha=1</TT>, <TT>sic_epsilon=1</TT>.

<P>
Comment 2:
When you apply this SIC scheme to a molecule or to an atom, which are neutral,
remember to add the correction to the energy level as proposed by Landau: 
in a neutral system, subtracting the self-interaction, the unpaired electron
feels a charged system, even if using a compensating positive background. 
For a cubic box, the correction term due to the Madelung energy is approx. 
given by <!-- MATH
 $1.4186/L_{box} - 1.047/(L_{box})^3$
 -->
1.4186/<I>L</I><SUB>box</SUB> -1.047/(<I>L</I><SUB>box</SUB>)<SUP>3</SUP>, where <I>L</I><SUB>box</SUB> is the 
linear dimension of your box (=celldm(1)). The Madelung coefficient is 
taken from I. Dabo et al. PRB 77, 115139 (2007).

4.4.2  ensemble-DFT </A>
</H3>

<P>
The ensemble-DFT (eDFT) is a robust method to simulate the metals in the 
framework of ''ab-initio'' molecular dynamics. It was introduced in 1997 
by Marzari et al.

<P>
The specific subroutines for the eDFT are in 
<TT>CPV/src/ensemble_dft.f90</TT> where you 
define all the quantities of interest. The subroutine 
<TT>CPV/src/inner_loop_cold.f90</TT>
called by <TT>cg_sub.f90</TT>, control the inner loop, and so the minimization of 
the free energy <I>A</I> with respect to the occupation matrix.

<P>
To select a eDFT calculations, the user has to set:
<PRE>
            calculation = 'cp'
            occupations= 'ensemble' 
            tcg = .true.
            passop= 0.3
            maxiter = 250
</PRE>
to use the CG procedure. In the eDFT it is also the outer loop, where the
energy is minimized with respect to the wavefunction keeping fixed the 
occupation matrix. While the specific parameters for the inner loop.
Since eDFT was born to treat metals, keep in mind that we want to describe 
the broadening of the occupations around the Fermi energy.
Below the new parameters in the electrons list, are listed.

<UL>
<LI><TT>smearing</TT>: used to select the occupation distribution;
there are two options: Fermi-Dirac smearing='fd', cold-smearing
smearing='cs' (recommended) 
</LI>
<LI><TT>degauss</TT>: is the electronic temperature; it controls the broadening
of the occupation numbers around the Fermi energy. 
</LI>
<LI><TT>ninner</TT>: is the number of iterative cycles in the inner loop, 
done to minimize the free energy <I>A</I> with respect the occupation numbers.
The typical range is 2-8.
</LI>
<LI><TT>conv_thr</TT>: is the threshold value to stop the search of the 'minimum' 
free energy.
</LI>
<LI><TT>niter_cold_restart</TT>: controls the frequency at which a full iterative
inner cycle is done. It is in the range 1 &#247;<TT>ninner</TT>. It is a trick to speed up 
the calculation.
</LI>
<LI><TT>lambda_cold</TT>: is the length step along the search line for the best 
value for <I>A</I>, when the iterative cycle is not performed. The value is close 
to 0.03, smaller for large and complicated metallic systems.
</LI>
</UL>
<EM>NOTE:</EM> <TT>degauss</TT> is in Hartree, while in <TT>PWscf</TT>is in Ry (!!!). 
The typical range is 0.01-0.02 Ha.

<EM>NOTA1</EM>  remember that the time step is to integrate the ionic dynamics,
so you can choose something in the range of 1-5 fs. 
<BR><EM>NOTA2</EM> with eDFT you are simulating metals or systems for which the 
occupation number is also fractional, so the number of band, <TT>nbnd</TT>, has to 
be chosen such as to have some empty states. As a rule of thumb, start
with an initial occupation number of about 1.6-1.8 (the more bands you 
consider, the more the calculation is accurate, but it also takes longer.
The CPU time scales almost linearly with the number of bands.) 
<BR><EM>NOTA3</EM> the parameter <TT>emass_cutoff</TT> is used in the preconditioning 
and it has a completely different meaning with respect to plain CP. 
It ranges between 4 and 7.

<P>
All the other parameters have the same meaning in the usual <TT>CP</TT> input, 
and they are discussed above.

The cutoff <TT>ecutrho</TT> defines the resolution on the real space FFT mesh (as expressed 
by <TT>nr1</TT>, <TT>nr2</TT> and <TT>nr3</TT>, that the code left on its own sets automatically).
In the USPP case we refer to this mesh as the "hard" mesh, since it 
is denser than the smooth mesh that is needed to represent the square 
of the non-norm-conserving wavefunctions.

<P>
On this "hard", fine-spaced mesh, you need to determine the size of the
cube that will encompass the largest of the augmentation charges - this
is what <TT>nr1b</TT>, <TT>nr2b</TT>, <TT>nr3b</TT> are. hey are independent 
of the system size, but dependent on the size
of the augmentation charge (an atomic property that doesn't vary 
that much for different systems) and on the
real-space resolution needed by augmentation charges (rule of thumb:
<TT>ecutrho</TT> is between 6 and 12 times <TT>ecutwfc</TT>).

<P>
The small boxes should be set as small as possible, but large enough
to contain the core of the largest element in your system.
The formula for estimating the box size is quite simple: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>nr1b</TT> = <!-- MATH
 $2 R_c / L_x \times$
 -->
2<I>R</I><SUB>c</SUB>/<I>L</I><SUB>x</SUB> <TT>x</TT> <TT>nr1</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
and the like, where <I>R</I><SUB>cut</SUB> is largest cut-off radius among the various atom
types present in the system, <I>L</I><SUB>x</SUB> is the
physical length of your box along the <I>x</I> axis. You have to round your
result to the nearest larger integer.
In practice, <TT>nr1b</TT> etc. are often in the region of 20-24-28; testing seems
again a necessity.

<P>
The core charge is in principle finite only at the core region (as defined
by some <I>R</I><SUB>rcut</SUB> ) and vanishes out side the core. Numerically the charge is
represented in a Fourier series which may give rise to small charge
oscillations outside the core and even to negative charge density, but
only if the cut-off is too low. Having these small boxes removes the
charge oscillations problem (at least outside the box) and also offers
some numerical advantages in going to higher cut-offs." (info by Nicola Marzari)

4.4.5 Hybrid functional calculations using maximally localized Wannier functions</A>

<P>
The parallelization scheme in this algorithm is based upon the number of electronic states. 
In the current implementation, there are certain restrictions on the choice of the number of MPI tasks.
Also slightly different algorithms are employed depending on whether the number of MPI tasks used in the calculation are greater or less than the number of electronic states.
We highly recommend users to follow the notes below.
This algorithm can be used most efficiently if the numbers of electronic states are uniformly distributed over the number of MPI tasks. 
For a system having N electronic states the optimum numbers of MPI tasks (nproc) are the following:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)</DT>
<DD>In case of nproc <IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$ \leq$"> N, the optimum choices are N/m, where m is any positive integer.
    
<UL>
<LI>Robustness:  Can be used for odd and even number of electronic states.
</LI>
<LI>OpenMP threads:  Can be used.
</LI>
<LI>Taskgroup:  Only the default value of the task group (-ntg 1) is allowed.
    
</LI>
</UL>
  
</DD>
<DT>(b)</DT>
<DD>In case of nproc  &gt; N, the optimum choices are N*m, where m is any positive integer.
    
<UL>
<LI>Robustness:  Can be used for even number of electronic states.
</LI>
<LI>Largest value of m:  As long as nj_max (see output) is greater than 1, 
        however beyond m=8 the scaling may become poor. The scaling should be tested by users.
</LI>
<LI>OpenMP threads: Can be used and highly recommended. We have tested number of threads
        starting from 2 up to 64. More threads are also allowed. 
        For very large calculations (nproc &gt; 1000 ) efficiency can largely depend on the computer 
        architecture and the balance between the MPI tasks and the OpenMP threads. 
        User should test for an optimal balance. Reasonably good scaling can be achieved by using 
        m=6-8 and OpenMP threads=2-16.
</LI>
<LI>Taskgroup:  Can be greater than 1 and users should choose the largest possible value
        for ntg. To estimate ntg, find the value of nr3x in the output and compute nproc/nr3x and
        take the integer value. We have tested the value of ntg as 2<SUP>m</SUP>, where m is any positive integer. 
        Other values of ntg should be used with caution.
</LI>
<LI>Ndiag:  Use -ndiag X option in the execution of cp.x. Without this option jobs
        may crash on certain architectures. Set X to any perfect square number which is equal to or less than N.

</UL>

<DT>&nbsp;$&bull#bullet;$</DT>
<DD>DEBUG:  The EXX calculations always work when number of MPI tasks = number of electronic states.
    In case of any uncertainty, the EXX energy computed using different numbers of MPI tasks can be
    checked by performing test calculations using number of MPI tasks = number of electronic states.
